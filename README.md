## 📖 Introduction

**Obex DNS** is a lightweight, scalable, and privacy-focused DNS resolution system. It runs entirely on Cloudflare's edge network, leveraging the ultra-fast response of Workers and the efficient storage of D1 database to provide users with a granular DNS (over HTTPS) control experience.

### Why Obex DNS?

| | Traditional DNS Services | Obex DNS |
|---|---|---|
| **Hosting** | Requires a VPS or home server | Runs on Cloudflare's free tier — no server needed |
| **Latency** | Depends on server location | Edge-computed in 300+ cities worldwide |
| **Maintenance** | Manual updates, OS patches | Zero-maintenance serverless deployment |
| **Scaling** | Limited by hardware | Scales automatically with Cloudflare's network |
| **Cost** | Server fees + electricity | Free for most personal usage |

> Deploy your own privacy-respecting DNS resolver in under 5 minutes — no credit card, no server, no DevOps.

### What is DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?

DoH (RFC 8484) is a protocol for performing DNS queries via encrypted HTTPS connections. Compared to traditional plaintext DNS, DoH can:
*   **Prevent Hijacking**: Prevents ISPs or third parties from tampering with DNS responses.
*   **Enhance Privacy**: Hides your browsing history through an encrypted tunnel.
*   **Bypass Censorship**: Provides more stable resolution in restricted network environments.

### Resolution Pipeline
When a DNS request arrives, it goes through the following processing stages:
1.  **Memory Cache Check**: Checks if a valid response for the query exists in the edge node's memory.
2.  **Config Loading**: Layers profile settings loading from Memory -> Cache API -> D1 Database.
3.  **Local Rule Matching**:
    -   **Whitelist**: If hit, forwards directly to upstream and returns.
    -   **Redirection**: If hit, returns custom records.
    -   **Blacklist**: If hit, returns NXDOMAIN, 0.0.0.0, or a custom result.
4.  **External List Filtering**:
    -   Use a **Bloom filter** for fast filtering.
5.  **Upstream Resolution**: If none of the above hit, requests the upstream DoH server based on configuration, with optional ECS support.
6.  **Async Logging & Caching**: Asynchronously records resolution logs, fetches target GeoIP, and writes results to various cache levels.

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Development Environment
-   **Node.js**: v18.x or later
-   **Package Manager**: npm
-   **Cloudflare Account**: Workers and D1 permissions required

### Local Development
1.  Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2.  Initialize D1 Database:

```bash
npm run db:setup
npm run db:migrate:dev
```

3.  Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4.  Deploy online

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Online Deployment (Cloudflare Dashboard)
1.  **Fork this repo**: Click the `Fork` button at the top right to clone the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create D1 Database**: Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard, go to `Workers & Pages` > `D1`, and create a new database (e.g., named `obex_db`), and copy the created database ID.
3.  **Configure Database ID**: In your forked repository, edit the `wrangler.toml` file and replace `database_id` with the ID of the database you just created.
4.  **Create Worker**: Go to Cloudflare dashboard `Workers & Pages` > `Create application` > `Create Worker`.
5.  **Import from GitHub**: On the deployment page, select `Deploy from GitHub`, connect your forked project, and complete the authorized deployment.

### Online Deployment to Cloudflare Pages (⚠️ Not Recommended)

If you wish to deploy the project using Cloudflare Pages (Advanced Mode):

> [!WARNING]
> **Not Recommended**: This project is primarily a DNS resolution service, which is highly sensitive to response latency. Workers, as lightweight edge functions, are much better suited for low-latency DoH resolution tasks compared to Pages Functions. Standard Worker deployment also offers simpler routing and binding management. We strongly suggest deploying via Workers instead.

1.  **Create a D1 Database**, copy its ID, and paste it into the `database_id` field in `wrangler.toml`.
2.  In the Cloudflare Dashboard, go to `Workers & Pages` > `Create application` > `Pages` > `Connect to Git`.
3.  Select your forked repository, and configure the build settings:
    *   **Framework preset**: `None`
    *   **Build command**: `npm run build:pages`
    *   **Build output directory**: `static`
4.  After the initial deployment, go to the Pages project's **Settings** > **Functions** > **D1 database bindings**, and add a binding:
    *   **Variable name**: `DB`
    *   **D1 database**: Select your `obex_db` database.
5.  Redeploy the Pages project for the bindings to take effect.
